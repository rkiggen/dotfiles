#+title: My collection of dotfiles
#+author: Rob Kiggen

Although I use NixOS for my personal laptop, I still like to keep my configurations in good old dotfiles.

_So why am I not using Home-Manager for this?_

1. I like to tinker with my configurations (think emacs, vim and such) and I find rebuilding the entire system to see my
   change in action very cumbersome;
2. For work I have to work on a variety of other machines (Windows, Ubuntu, Rocky Linux, ...) where I still like to use
   the same configurations for most of my apps.

But managing a host of dotfiles isn't always simple, which is why I am using [[https://www.chezmoi.io/][chezmoi]] nowadays.
